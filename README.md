In this project, i used the variance to determine the month with the most suitable weather to visit London.. My project discovered that the coldest month fell in February, while the hotest month fell in July... The best month to visit London from my data analysis project with not too much cold or excess heat therefore falls around the Month of March with 7.935419 degree celcius, as can be seen in the Mothly_Stats table available in the file titled Variance in Weather R3, when displayed in R-Studio.. The main project code is in the file titled Variance in Weather R2.
